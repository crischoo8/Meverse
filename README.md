# MeverseApp - Like Weverse, minus 99.999% of other people's opinions

### Deployment
 [Click here to view project](https://meverse.vercel.app/)

### Description 
Purpose of the app:
The code for this project will provide a template for kpop fans to create a blog of their own where they can keep a log of their fan experiences ~~(without facing judgement from 'muggles')~~. The website will have the following features: 
+ Favourites List (Users can keep track of favourite idols *Uses Airtable*)
+ Profiles (Users can browse relevant profiles of favourite idols *Uses K-POP Thunder API*)
+ Rando Bop (Users can generate a random song. *Uses K-POP Thunder API*)
+ Journal Log (Users can input anything in plain text. *Uses Airtable*)

### Unsolved Issues
The PATCH function (kinda) works but I hope to rewrite the code for it after the project is assessed.

### APIs Used
+ [Airtable API] (airtable.com)
+ [K-POP, ThunderAPI] (https://rapidapi.com/thunderapi-thunderapi-default/api/k-pop)
